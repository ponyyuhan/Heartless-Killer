# Heartless-Killer
a text adventure game based on RPGMAKER    

This is a game developed with RPGmaker. Because it is the first game I developed, it looks very rough.   
Thanks to campfireman for your great help!   
important!   
After downloading the zip file through GitHub, it will appear that nw.dll is not specified to run on windows. To solve this problem, you need to find the nw.dll file in GitHub. After downloading it separately, overwrite the nw.dll file in the zip folder! ! !
